For making 2 pizzas

For making the base:
Mix the multi purpose flour(maida) and the rest of the ingredients for the base properly till you get it mixed and smooth.
Then shape the base in the way you want it(I suggest circle).
Make the base approximatey half a centimetre in height.
Put your base on the stove for 1-2 minutes(This gets the base a bit crunchy when you actually bake the pizza).
Now cut the veges in small pieces.
Apply sauce on the base and sprinkle the veges after cutting them.
Sprinkle cheese according to your needs around on the pizza.
Bake it in an oven for 10-15 minutes.
Take the pizza out of the oven on a plate.
Cut it the way you want(I suggest straight cuts, they are the easiest to do).
Serve it in a nice plate and you are done!!!
